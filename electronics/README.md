# Electronics Workshop

## Project

The goal of the project is to learn what an Arduino is and how it can be useful
in projects. Thus, you can build anything you like using the provided
components. The only requirement is that you put some effort into it and show
us that you've learned something. The project can be as complex as you want,
just try to deliver a finished product.

If you need help, feel free to reach out to us (`RiscadoA#1480` or
`Joao-Ex-Machina#2002`) on Discord. **Don't forget to inform us of the topic**
**of your project** first so that we can confirm that it's not too easy or too
hard. If you're having trouble deciding on a project, we can help you with
that too.

After you've finished the project, we'll schedule a time for you to present it
to us. You must submit the code and the circuit schematic before the final due
date.

The relevant dates are:
- Topic confirmation: **Wednesday, 22nd of March**
- Project submission: **Tuesday, 28th of March**
